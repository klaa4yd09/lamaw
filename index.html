            <h2>Hi Lori&#128151 </h2>
            <p>
                
                You'll always have me, I promise. Even if the world will go against us. Even if distance separate us. Even if we don't communicate often, and even if my heart is partially disappointed for not
                being with you everyday. You'll always have me. You have made me the happiest person alive. I don't think anyone else can be floating on cloud nine like me. The reason I say that is only you can make me feel
                like this, nobody else can touch this. You are everything to me.
                I hope you always remember, my heart belongs to you. No matter where I go or what I do,
                my heart finds its way back to you, for it was always yours, and always will be. 
               <br> HAPPY VALENTINES&#10083; 
                <br> Forever yours, <br> <br>
                Klyde </p>
